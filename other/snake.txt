So, here's the problem:

   0  1  2  3  4  5
  -----------------
0| 1  2  6  7  15 16
1| 3  5  8  14 ...
2| 4  9  13 ...
3| 10 12 ...
4| 11 ...

You have some number n from this sequence (from snake's "track").
Compute x and y (indices of n). For example: 13 ---> 2, 2
Your solution must run in constant time.
