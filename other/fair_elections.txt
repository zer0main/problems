Problem
-------
There are N servers. You need to invent an algorithm of single
server elections. There are some cheaters among servers (but not
the majority!).

You have:
 - Connectivity between servers
 - Eeach server has RSA key
 - Eeach server has a list of public RSA keys of other servers
 - All the strength of cryptography
