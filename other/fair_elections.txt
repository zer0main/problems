Problem
-------
There are N servers. You need to invent an algorithm of single
server elections. There are some cheaters among servers (but not
the majority!).

You have:
 - Connectivity between servers
 - Eeach server has RSA key
 - Eeach server has a list of public RSA keys of other servers
 - All the strength of cryptography

Solution
--------
0) Each server has score points (initially 1). Score is just a
    sum of scores of servers beaten by the current server.

Let's organize Olympic system tournament:

1) Servers divide into pairs. In each pair they play the following game:
   A: send** score points (with proof*) to B
   B: send** score points (with proof*) to A
   * Proof is full log with all messages A <--> B.
   ** All the messages are sent in broadcast mode and signed using RSA.
   Assign max_number to ScoreA + ScoreB
   A: generate random number in range [0, max_number)
   A: generate salt
   A: assign VoteA to salt and generated random number
   A: send hash of VoteA to B
   B: generate random numbers in range [0, max_number). Quantity of
       random numbers is equal to score of B.
   B: generate salt
   Assign VoteB to salt and generated random numbers
   B: send hash of VoteB to A
   A: after receiving hash from B, send VoteA to B
   B: after receiving hash from A, send VoteB to A
   A: check hash of received VoteB (compare with received hash)
   B: check hash of received VoteA (compare with received hash)
   If number generated by A enters into set of numbers generated by B,
    B wins (ScoreB += ScoreA).
   Otherwise A wins (ScoreA += ScoreB).

2) We have single winner of Olympic system tournament so
    we've solved the problem.

Discussion
----------
The power of two problem: servers can't divide into pairs if their
quantity isn't a power of two.

Score points help us to solve problems with power of two when
use Olympic system tournament. Excess servers (which don't play
in some tournaments because of power of two problem) don't get
score points in this tournament so when they fight with winners
of this tournament, they have less chances to win.
