Problem
-------
There are N servers. You need to invent an algorithm of single
server elections. There are some crooks among servers (but not
the majority!).
You have:
 - TCP connection between servers
 - Every server has PGP key
 - Every server has list of public PGP keys of other servers
 - All the strength of cryptography
