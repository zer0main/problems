Problem
=======

Input: array of integers G; X
Output: find 2 elements A and B in the given array for which
        (A XOR B == X) is true.

Comment: DO NOT suggest O(N * N), *geniuses*!

Solution
========

1) Make array C (C[i] = (G[i] XOR X)).
2) Find equal elements of C and G.
   Let's say we have (C[i] == G[x]):
   G[x] and G[i] - our ANSWER.

`2` can be done in 2 ways:

A: Make hash table from one of arrays.
   Check all the elements of another array for being present in
   the hash table.
Comment: worst cases suck, yeah!

B: Combine arrays, store indices, do count sort, check nearby elements for equality.
Comment: memory... :(
