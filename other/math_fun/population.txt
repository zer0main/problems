PROBLEM
In some country people live (for a long time) following the rules:
each family gives birth to children until the first boy.
Only girls and boys may born (no twins etc), they born with equal
chances. The mortality rate does not depend on gender.
What is the proportion of male population in this country?

SOLUTION
It's a problem with a trap. The Rule of single boy per family does
not affect the probability of boys to born in general in whole country.
The correct answer is 50%.
