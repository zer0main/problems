Problem
=======

There're K experiments with 2 possible results. The probability
of positive one is N. Calculate the probability that M-th
success will take place exactly at K-th experiment.

Solution
========

ANS = (N ** M) * ((1 - N) ** (K - M)) * C(M - 1; K - 1) =
= (N ** M) * (((1 - N) ** (K - M)) * (K - 1)!) / ((K - M)! * (M - 1)!)
