Problem
=======

There're K experiments with 2 possible results. The probability
of posistive one is N. Calculate the probability that M-th
success will take place exactly at K-th experiment.

Solution
========

ANS = (N ** K) * ((1 - N) ** (M - K)) * C(K - 1; M - 1) =
= (N ** K) * (((1 - N) ** (M - K)) * (M - 1)!) / ((M - K)! * (K - 1)!)
