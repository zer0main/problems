1. Problem: make generator of probability 1/3 using the normal coin (1/2).

Solution
--------
Two consecutive coin flips give us 4 combinations (head-head, tail-tail,
head-tail, tail-head). We can exclude one of these combinations
(just start everything from the beginning in the case of an
unwanted combination). We get three equally probable outcomes.
